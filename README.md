# Adv-KTS-Project
* School Project for Advanced Digital System Design
* Content: 3 minor personal projects and 1 major group project 
* Files are written in Verilog, testbenches included.
* Program: ModelSim PE Student Edition 10.4a.
* Requirements for projects: all designs are done with logic gates only (OR, AND, NOT, NAND, XOR, XOR).
